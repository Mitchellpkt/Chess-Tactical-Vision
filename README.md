# Chess tactical vision
Augmented chess board visualization by overlaying all possible attacks/defenses

Designed to aid in assessing board position and calculating tactics.

Use 1: training oneself by solving puzzles with enhanced vision

Use 2: if both parties agree in advance, playing on a field with enhanced vision for both players 

It would be neat to add this to Lichess studies and post-game analysis (i.e. the same pages where stockfish is enabled)

!!!! Don't be a scumbag and use this for cheating.
